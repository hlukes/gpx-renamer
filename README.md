# gpx-renamer
This is a python GPX file renamer.
It can rename your gpx files using relevant info from the file itself (time,duration etc.) as well as with place names, which it obtains from a BigDataCloud Geocoding API.  
Currently, standalone version is functional and structed is is being worked on.  
Structured version should provide a settings json file, where you can change some default settings that can be only changed in the python script itself in the standalone version.  
It should also separate the Tkinter GUI and the gpx moving process, making the code cleaner and easier to read and change.
## Standalone
This is an early version of GPX renamer with tkinter GUI
Works as is, as long as you provide:
* key.json file with your bigdatacloud API key (in the same folder as the script) like this:
    ```json
        {
        "key":"your_key_here"
        }
    ```
### Folder selection:
This program can use 4 folder, however, just 2 are needed
* input - folder with the GPX files to move and rename
* ouput - folder for the renamed files
* orig (optional) - if specified, copies all files from input here begore processing them
* manual (optional) - for incomplete GPX files or non-GPX files
#### automatic
Searches for folders name like the above in the same folder the script is in
#### manual
You can specify paths to all the folders in the GUI

### Output options and missing info handeling
Two textboxes between the two start buttons
First textbox:
#### Output format
You can specify the format of the output
* uses percent sign (%) followed by letter(s) for every piece of information
* This is the default format, you can change it in the code itself, currently on line 516:
    ```python 
        self.formatEntryText.set("%f-%y-%m-%st-%e")
    ```
* You can use only characters specified in the whitelist (currently with czech characters)
    ```python
        whitelist = set(string.ascii_letters + string.digits + "!_-()ěščřžýáíéĚŠČŘŽÝÁÍÉÚŮúůťď∶ ")
    ```
* the percent placeholders are as follows:
    ```
        %c      country code - always
        %dur    duration in format hour:minute
        %f      country code, only when not cz (deletes one character next to itselft if not cz)
                - you can change the country code to ignore on line 224
        %st     locality of the first point- API
        %e      locality of the last point - API
        %y      year of the first point
        %m      month of the first point
        %d      day of first point
        %ts     time of start in format  hour:minute
        %te     time of end in format  hour:minute
    ```
You can change these placeholders, BUT you always have to define more specific placeholders first (%dur before %d), not doing so will result will in incorrect format in output file names.
#### Missing info handeling
Defines how to handle missing info (empty time, locality etc.)
```
        "0" - deletes one of surrounding characters
        "1" - doesn't delete anything
        "2" - moves the final gpx to manual if specified, otherwise as "0"
```
## Structured
Not yet functional, work in progress
